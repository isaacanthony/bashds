### Concatenating CSVs with a Header Row
Given a directory of CSVs all containing:

* a starting header row
* identical columns
* file names ending with `.csv`

the following commands will concatenate them into a single file, `all.csv`.

```
ls *.csv | grep -v all.csv | head -1 | xargs -I {} head -1 {} > all.csv
ls *.csv | grep -v all.csv | xargs -I {} tail -n +2 {} >> all.csv
```

### Concatenating CSVs with no Header Row
Given a directory of CSVs all containing:

* no header row
* identical columns
* file names ending with `.csv`

the following commands will concatenate them into a single file, `all.csv`.

```
rm all.csv && touch all.csv
ls *.csv | grep -v all.csv | xargs -I {} cat {} >> all.csv
```

## <a name="file-encoding"></a> File Encoding

### Detecting a File's Encoding
Given a plaintext file `data.csv`, the following command will print its encoding.
```
file -i data.csv
```

## <a name="file-encryption"></a> File Encryption

### Decrypting Files using PGP
Given a file `data.csv.pgp` encrypted using PGP, the following command will decrypt the file and store it as `data.csv`. You will be automatically prompted for the password associated with your PGP key.
```
gpg --output data.csv --decrypt data.csv.pgp
```

### Creating an Encrypted ZIP File of a Directory
Given a directory `data`, the following command will create an encrypted ZIP file of that directory and store it as `data.zip`. You will be automatically prompted from the command line for the password to be used in the encryption/decryption.
```
zip -er data.zip data
```
